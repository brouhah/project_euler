# Problem 1: Multiples of 3 and 5

> If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5, we get 3, 5, 6 and 9. The sum of these multiples is 23.
> Find the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1000.

## Post-Mortem

Most of the work I did for this solution was converting [my JavaScript solution to this problem](../../js/0001_multiples_of_3_and_5/README.md)
